Student and Faculty delete is not working (options 6 and 8).
    When I make a student object, delete it, and then print, the data still prints. However, I get a segfault if I delete it again
    This could be related to the fact that we aren't deleting the student object, only the node. We might need to overload DeleteNode to fix This
        However, IDK if this is it b/c the tree print method still uses the nodes to access the student for printing
        Not deleting the student/faculty is still a problem, but I'm not sure if it is breaking anything

Adding more than one student or faculty causes segfault (opions 5 and 7)
    We might want to check some of our LazyBST code. Maybe get some official code from Rene

-----NOTE-----
Above probably works once we finish balancing
