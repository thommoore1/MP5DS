Student and Faculty delete is not working (options 6 and 8).
    When I make a student object, delete it, and then print, the data still prints. However, I get a segfault if I delete it again

Student change advisor gives segfault (option 9)
    This is because you need the current advisor to exist, and the new advisor to exist

Adding more than one student or faculty causes segfault (opions 5 and 7)
    We might want to check some of our LazyBST code. Maybe get some official code from Rene
